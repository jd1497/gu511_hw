    "\n",
    "let's use [the google maps directions `api`](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/start) (itself one of [many, many open `api`s from google](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/)) to calculate the travel time from any arbitrary location to the Washington monument\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1: not spending a billion dollars\n",
    "\n",
    "before using any `api`, you should double-check the usage limits and pricing model. `google` is usually pretty friendly to small hacking projects, so we should be okay -- but let's make sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "head over to [the directions `api` usage limits documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/usage-limits) and determine how `google` charges users for `api` calls. try and answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. is any amount of access free? or does it all cost some amount of money?\n",
    "1. who is charged, the user or someone else?\n",
    "1. how does `google` know who to charge?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**actually think about it!**\n",
    "\n",
    "thought about it? here are the answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `google` charges users 0.005 USD per each `api` call\n",
    "1. I have created an account and am using the 300 USD promotional credit that comes with it -- this means we collectively have 60,000 calls left before I start paying. please don't do this homework question 1000s of times.\n",
    "1. `google` associates requests to an individual's `google` account by using an **api key** -- a unique string\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2: getting an `api` key\n",
    "\n",
    "many applications require users to create `api` keys as a way of authenticating requests. this serves several purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. security: if you notice malicious actors, you have a way of shutting them down immediately\n",
    "2. audit: you have a record of exactly who made every request, which is useful for retrospective analysis of usage, malicious action, etc.\n",
    "3. throttling and resource management: you can identify major consumers of your resource and quantify how much they are taxing your resources\n",
    "4. the big one: **billing**. in this instance, the key tells `google` who to charge\n",
    "\n",
    "let's head to the [google api key page](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/get-api-key) (**don't** press any buttons yet, folks) and read up a bit on it. if you wanted to use the api, you'd need to *activate* it for your account and get an *api key* from `google`.\n",
    "\n",
    "in the email announcing this assignment, I sent you my `api` key. I considered posting it as a `gist` but decided against it in order to keep it at least semi-private. *this is a password!!* -- it really shouldn't be shared, let alone public. this is a violation of a best practice to save you all a few bucks!\n",

    "\n",
    "translate the above url into a `python requests` library `GET` request. verify that the `json()` element of the returned response item is the same as the `json` that is returned via the browser. that is, write code like\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "the thing you get from `response.json()` should be a python object (`list`s and `dict`s). figure out how to take the compound `dict` and `list` object the `requests` library returns and extract the numerical `value` of the `duration` of the trip (the duration of the trip in seconds). depending on the route `google` recommends, this could change slightly. when I ran it just now, I saw\n",
