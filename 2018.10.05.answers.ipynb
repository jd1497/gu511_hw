    "\n",
    "+ [Data Community DC](http://www.datacommunitydc.org/meetups-overview/). this is an umbrella organization covering a ton of the local data science organization and meetup scene. there are currently 10 sub-meetup groups focused on different topics, and I've found that the quality of the individual presentations varies but is generally more worth attending than not\n",
    "    + [calendar of upcoming events](http://www.datacommunitydc.org/calendar/)\n",
    "+ [DataKind DC](http://www.meetup.com/DataKind-DC/): this is a really interesting group which works with nonprofits in the area to identify data science problems that could be of use to those organizations. There is a team of professional volunteers who work with the nonprofits before it ever gets to you, the data scientisit volunteers. this means that the projects that you are walking into are usually *at least* scoped and vetted, leaving you with something tangible to look into. you and a dozen or so other data scientists will then help that nonprofit put together a data science solution a real problem they have.\n",
    "    + this is a *great* way to get experience working on a team on a scoped and defined data science problem. in my experience, whether you see success, failure, or something inbetween, this is **invaluable experience for future interviews** for real data science positions\n",
    "    + there are multiple projects to pick from each meeting so you can see if any of the projects speak to you technically or personally.\n",
    "+ [Code for DC](https://codefordc.org/): this is much like DataKind above, but less specifically focused on data science and covering a much larger collection of projects. if you are interested in coding generally, or seeing if you can find a good applciation of your data science skills in these settings, I highly recommend this friendly group. they will take on folks of *all* experience levels, especially including none. they're happy to teach, in my experience.\n",
